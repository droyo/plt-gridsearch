A graph application for Drscheme

Implementation notes

First and foremost, this project is being made to address problems
with what we already have, the swl-based grid search. In order to do
this, I propose the following goals.

* Persistent window

  The window itself is not opened or closed. Instead, a function is
  sent to the running application, and a player appears on the drawing
  area. If PLT has any way to serialize lambdas over a network
  connection, we could even have one window open with multiple people
  uploading search functions to it. (Or we could send the source over
  the network and evaluate it) We want an interface something like
  this.

  (define (my-grid-search grid current-node)
    ...)

  (send-to-grid my-grid-search "Name")

  Or, if you use global variables all over the place and other state:
  (send-to-grid "my-gridsearch.scm" "Other_name")

  These functions should return a list of vertices to travel to. The
  return value is checked for consistency and if everything is okay,
  it is ready to run.

* GUI interface
  - There should be a slider to control the speed
  - You should be able to place players with the mouse
  - There should be pause/play buttons and a button to clear the screen
  - Too much work: a rewind button

* Under the hood
