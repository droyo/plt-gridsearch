* Things that need to be done

** Aesthetics

   I'd like to clean up the drawing code and organize it so one can
   choose from different drawing styles. We could have a drawing style
   that mimics a grid, for example.

** Weights

   Our graph data structure can trivially represent weighted
   edges. Should we choose to use them we should add an appropriate
   visual cue.

** Distance

   In Gary's gridsearch, because each grid cell had coordinates,
   computing the distance to the goal was as easy as pie. However,
   because we are using abstract, mathematical graphs with an infinite
   number of visual representations, this is no longer applicable.

   One solution would be to provide the user with a function that
   returns the coordinates of a vertex.
   
** Player-player interaction

   The easiest way of letting players know about the location of other
   players would be to pass another function that returns a list of
   other player positions, perhaps with their names.

** Layout

   The grid layout is acceptable for some graphs, but this application
   is really missing a general grid layout algorithm.

** Documentation

   This application is near feature complete. Once the things in this
   TODO are taken care of, I'd like to focus more on documenting the
   source code, because this app will be in the care of CS students,
   it must be accessible! The main reason this program was created was
   because the current grid search application we were using was
   large, undocumented, and inaccessible. We don't want to repeat the
   same mistake.

   I will start working on a guide with pictures and code that can be
   hosted on the github wiki page.

*** Code quality issues

    There are some inconsistencies in the code, such as:
    - The arbitrary interchanging of "vertex" and "node"

    - Sometimes ambiguous arguments: Some of the decisions to pass a
      graph-info struct over the actual graph data structure are
      pretty arbitrary, and make the interactions a little tangled.

    I would like to add some cleaner separation between the UI code
    and the rest of the program. But for now, it works, it is not too
    complicated, and it does not pollute the user search programs like
    the previous grid-search did.
